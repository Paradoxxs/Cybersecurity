Is the concept of layered defense 
*Prevention is idea but detection is a must; however, detection without response has minimal value*

What is defense in depth
	Security with multiple solutions tired together to accomplish a goal. There is no single security solution that can secure a organization. because any single system can be bypassed. 
	Defense in depth is a design philosophy the idea comes from software have flaws, misconfiguration happens and hardware failure, to compensate for these events, we similar do not relay on a single system of protection. instead we deploy multiple layers of protection to account for the possibility that one will fail. 

Security is [[Risk mangement]] to assets. Risk is the probability of a threat occurring 
*Threats x Vulnerability = risk*
With the goal to minimize risk and protect [[CIA triad]]


Approaches to defense in depth
	Uniform protection
		treats all systems equally. As a result, this approach can be more vulnerable to insiders , because system are not separated  within the network. 
	Protected enclaves
		Involves segmenting the network, by VLAN segmentation and firewalls to separate the network. 
	Information centric
		At the center of the protection is anything you value. Around that center you build successive layers of protections. 
	Vector-Oriented 
		Involes identifying vectors by which threats can become manifested and providing security mechanisms to shut down the vector.
