Is the concept of layered defense 
*Prevention is idea but detection is a must; however, detection without response has minimal value*

What is defense in depth
	Security with multiple solutions tired together to accomplish a goal. There is no single security solution that can secure a organization. because any single system can be bypassed. 
	Defense in depth is a design philosophy the idea comes from software have flaws, misconfiguration happens and hardware failure, to compensate for these events, we similar do not relay on a single system of protection. instead we deploy multiple layers of protection to account for the possibility that one will fail. 

Security is [[Risk mangement]] to assets. Risk is the probability of a threat occurring 
*Threats x Vulnerability = risk*
With the goal to minimize risk and protect [[CIA triad]]


Approaches to defense in depth
	Uniform protection
		treats all systems equally. As a result, this approach can be more vulnerable to insiders , because system are not separated  within the network. 
	Protected enclaves
		Involves segmenting the network, by VLAN segmentation and firewalls to separate the network. 
	Information centric
		At the center of the protection is anything you value. Around that center you build successive layers of protections. 
	Vector-Oriented 
		Involes identifying vectors by which threats can become manifested and providing security mechanisms to shut down the vector.

Security policy 
Policies address the who, what and why. 
Procedures the how, where and when. 

Baseline are mandatory specific implementation of a standard that must be followed.  
Guideline are suggestions, best practices. 

Table of content for policy
	-	Purpose : Reason for the policy
	-	Related documents or references : cities other policy or guidance
	-	Expiration : New or update my supersede existing policy. Should identify 
	-	Background
	-	Scope : the depth and breadth of coverage
	-	Policy statement : What is to be done
	-	Responsibility
	-	Action : what action must be taken
	
The policy must be Specific, achievable, realistic, time based and measurable
Contain the guiding principle and the Who, What, Where, when and why. 
	
When creating the policy certain steps must be taken, State the issue at hand, Identify the players, Find relevant documentation, Define the policy, Penalties for non-compliance, make it enforceable 

Contingency planning 
Key components 
Planning 
	-	Assess : Identify threats (BIA)
	-	Evaluate : likelihood and impact of threat 
	BCP
		-	Prepare
		-	Mitigate
	DRP
		-	Respond
		-	Recover

Business Impact Analysis (BIA) document what impact a disruptive event might have on the cooperation, The primary goal of BIA is to determine the maximum allow downtime of any system, Understanding the maximum tolerable downtime. without this you wont know the impact of downtime the system has on operation. 


Business continuity plan (BCP) is a strategic plan focusing on the availability of critical business processes, it define a plan for emergency response, backup operations and post disaster recovery, It the last line of defense against risks that cannot be controlled. 
Business continuity plan is a collection of other plans 
	Disaster recovery plan
	-	End-user recovery 
	-	Contingency plan
	-	Emergency response plan
	-	Crisis management plant


Disaster recovery plan (DRP) covers the tactical recovery of IT system in the event of disaster or disruption, consisting of 
-	Recovery of data center
-	Recovery of business operations
-	Recovery of business location 
-	Recovery of business processes
