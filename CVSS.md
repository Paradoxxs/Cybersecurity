Common vulnerability scoring system

CVSS:3.0 = This score is generated using CVSS 3.0 (as opposed to version 2.0)
AV:N = Attack Vector: Network (Exploitation can occur over a network, such as the Internet)
AC:L = Attack Complexity: Low (This attack is easy to conduct, and requires little technical sophistication)
PR:N = Privileges Required: None (The attacker does not need an account with any specific permissions for successful exploitation)
UI:R = User Interaction: None (Exploitation does not rely on a legitimate user doing something, such as clicking something or opening a malicious file)
S:U = Scope: Unchanged (The scope for this vulnerability has not been changed)
C:H = Confidentiality Impact: High (Confidentiality is broken, meaning the attack will gain access to files or information that should be restricted)
I:H = Integrity Impact: High (Integrity is broken, meaning the attack is able to modify files or information)
A:H = Availability Impact: High (Availability is broken, meaning the attack can restrict legitimate access to a system)
