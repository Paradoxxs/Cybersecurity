You never find bugs in code, you do not execute. 
Fuzzing is a software testing mechanism that sends malformed data to protocol implementations. This could be a server process. web application or a file. 
Fuzzing is considered a essential part of software development lifecycle with security in mind. developer that utilize fuzzing have a higher chance of identifying flaws. 
Programming is a useful skills for fuzzing, two popular language are python and ruby. 
Fuzzing is fault-testing technique for discovering vulnerabilities 
Fuzzing Techniques 
	Static test cases 
		 Is list of testes that analyst have develop, that can be ran through to do a test of the target in question. 
	 Randomized 
	 	Utilize a valid data set and replace portions of the data with randomized content. Requires little to no knowledge of the protocol. and a quick way to get started. 
	Mutation 
		Similar too Randomized techniques, instead it performs an iterative replacement of values in the data. 
	Intelligent Mutation 
		Here the analyst with a grammar definition, were the fields that can be target. allowing them to discover vulnerabilities that other fuzzing techniques would not. 
	
Grammer with [[Sulley]]
Grammer is a describing a data format. 
	-	Functions to examine and count mutations. 
Post-mortem tools aid in crash analysis and cleanup. 

Tool 
 -	Taof: Mutation
