# HTTPS
#web #encryption 
HTTPS work similiar to [[HTTP]] the difference between the two is the [[Encyption]]  layer which uses SSL/TLS [[Asymmetric encryption]]
HTTPS used to provide the [[CIA triad]] using the [[PKI]], the way it archive this is by 
using port 443 and encrypt the information using SSL/TLS 

How it works 
	- Client connects to server
	-	Server indicates need for SSL 
	-	Client and server exchange crypto keys
	-	Secure sessions begins

Web browser will display an warring when a certificate is invalid for any reason.
