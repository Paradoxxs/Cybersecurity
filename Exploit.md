 The definition of an exploit "A piece of software, chunk of data, or sequence of commands that takes advantages of a bug, glitch or vulnerability in order to cause unintended behavior to occur in the software, hardware."
 
 The risk of exploitation from a [[penetration testing]] point of view
 	- Crash of system or service. 
	- Stability impact.
	- Data exposed
	- Accessing out of scope system.
It there for important from a pen-test that exploitation is allowed by the [[Rules of engagement ]]

Most exploits fall into one of three categories
 - Service-side exploit
	 - Attacks on service that listening on the network.
 - Client-side exploit
	 - Attacking host application that communicate over the network.
	 Gaining information about the target application version could be gained from [[Reconnaissance#^f74e91]]
 - Local privilege escalation exploits 
	 - Going from limited access to higher privileges either on the system or domain. 
		- Race conditions
			 Is when order or timing of an application if thrown off you lead to escalation of privilege. 
		- Kernel attacks
			Exploiting flaws in the operation system. 
		- Program or service 
			Making process execute desired higher privilege actions. 
 [[Metasploit]] is a free tool that can help with the exploitation phase. 
 
 After exploit have been successfully you go into the [[Post Exploitation]] phase.
