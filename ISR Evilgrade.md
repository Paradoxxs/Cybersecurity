ISR Evilgrade is a exploit tool designed to exploit weak software update, It monitors the network as MITM using a list of software targets. When it observes a request from a client to check for updated, it sends a response back to the client, telling at an update is available. in the response Evilgrade indicates the URL to download the update from the attackers machine. 
In order to use this exploit, we must trick the clients into thinking that we are the software update server. This can be done by manipulating DNS and the preferred MITM tools like [[Ettercap]]
