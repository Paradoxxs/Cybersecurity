Firewall
A firewall is a network device that provides fundamental network security, by monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic and determining whether to allow or block it, based on rules. Firewalls can come in software form, or hardware form as physical devices that are plugged into network infrastructure. This allow us to create private networks, where only intended communications can come in, or out.
