Firewall
Firewall takes it name from the firewall that is meant to prevent the spread of fire from one portions of structure to another within a building.

Firewall is a network device that provides fundamental network security, by monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic and determining whether to allow or block it, based on rules. Firewalls can come in software or hardware form, as physical devices they are plugged into network infrastructure. This allow us to create private networks, where only intended communications can come in or out.

Default deny - denied all traffic if not otherwise specified
Default allow - Allows all traffic if not otherwise specified
