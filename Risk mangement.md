Risk management is determining the risks the organization is exposed to. and to explore various approaches and techniques for managing these risks.  
Risk can be manged in different way by reducing it, accepting the risk or transferring the risk. 

Process of risk management:
	-	 Rapid assessment of risks, to understand what security policy need to cover. 
	-	 Fully analyses risk 
	-	Setup security infrastructure
	-	Design controls, write standards for each technology
	-	device which resources are available prioritize countermeasures and implement op priority
	-	Periodic reviews and possible test
	-	Implement intrusion prevention and incident response. 

When evaluating risk some key question need to answered 
	-	 What could happen?
	-	What is the impact of the threat
	-	How often could it happen?
	-	How reliable are the answers to the questions above?
	

Risk is the probability of a threat occurring 
*Threats x Vulnerability = risk*

What is Threat? 
	Any activities that represent possible danger to information or operations
	Type of threat 
		-	 Physical
			-	Fire, Flood, etc. 
		-	Electronic
			-	Malware, Insider, etc. 
		
Vulnerabilities
	Are the weaknesses in a system, They are inherent in any complex system and will always be present. 
	Vulnerability falls into different category 
		-	Known, known - know to both parties
		- 	Known, unknown - know to you, unknown to others
		-	Unknown, Known - Unknown to you, know to other
		-	Unknown, Unknown - Unknown to both parties
		

Single loss expectancy (SLE)
SLE is the value that a assign to  single event. the formula 
	*SLA = Assent value ($) x Exposure factor*
Exposure factor is the percentages of loss a threat event would have on the asset. and is expressed in % 	


Annualized Loss expectancy (ALE)
What happens when events occurs more then once, this is what ALE is used to calculate for.  *ALE = SLE x Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO)*

ARO is the estimated frequency at which a threat is expected to occur. the value range from zero to infinite 


Quantitative vs Qualitative
There two risk assessment approaches quantitative and qualitative. in quantitative risk assessment, we try to assign an objective numeric value. 
Qualitative risk deals with more intangible values and focuses on variables and not just monetary losses


Quantitative risk assessment works on metrics. Bottom line cost i what management want when trying to understand the implications of how risk affect the organization. 

Qualitative risk assessment perform risk on wireless LAN, First is to determine the vulnerabilities, threat the risk of using wireless. One of the risk of Wireless it someone sniffing the network. Can you put a monetary value on this risk?  

Quantitative risk analysis in certain situation does not work. This is were qualitative is much better, because it can arrive at a more subjective result.
