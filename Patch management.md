Patch management 
	Keeping your system secure is to maintain the system patch level at all times. The top reason systems get compromised is still un-patched system. 
	The best way to ensure your system is always up to date is to use an automated patching program while this is ideal for end user system, it may not be good for production systems. There is no way to know how patches will effect your system, especially third party software. The best way to prevent this is to have an automated patching program announce the update but not install them. This will allow the ability to test and evaluate the patch prior to deployment.
