Host-based intrusion detection
	 Software that reside on host machine and monitors the traffic in and out as well as the integrity of host files. HIDS can be trained to record a system baseline and then alert when change unexpectedly. 
	 It scans the packages in its full content, ensuring there is no malicious code. 
	Where firewall only scan IP header, it good idea to have both for security in depth.
	HIDS uses signature and anomaly analyses, File integrity check.
	
Advantages 
	-	Allows to identify inside attacks on the system. 
	-	Protecting the host no matter the location. 
	
Challenges 
	-	Deployment and maintenance of each HIDS.
	-	Required centralized console to identify trends. 
	-	Impact host performance.
