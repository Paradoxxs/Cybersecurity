The scanning phase of hacking
- The goal of scanning is to learn more about the target, where it differ from reconnaissance is that scanning interact with the target.
- The workflow of the scanning phase.
    - Network sweep → network tracing → port scanning →OS fingerprint → version scan → vulnerability scanning.
- If required to work handle large scans, the best way to do this is by taking a sample size that represents the overall data set. 
- tcp control bit? 
- CWR : congestion windows reduction
- ECE explicit congestion notification echo
- tcp behavior while port scanning? 
- upd behavior while scanning? 
- Tools for port scanning is [[Nmap]] and [[Scapy]]
- Vulnerability scanning
    - Discovering vulnerabilities in the system can be done with many tools here I will focus on two [[Nmap]] and [[Nessus]].
