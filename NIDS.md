Network-based intrusion detection
	Sit on the network and scan the packet both inbound and outbound, compared to [[Firewall]] which scan the header, NIDS scans the whole packet to detect if the packet is malicious or not. 
	The downside of NIDS compare to [[HIDS]] is that it cannot protect the user if they are not on the network. e.g. working from home.
