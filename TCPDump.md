TCPDump is a command-line tool which, like Wireshark, can be used to capture network traffic and view and analyse PCAP capture files. TCPDump has the benefit of not needing GUI access to a host in order to use it â€“ this property is very useful when you have remote shell access, e.g. during a penetration test, and need to get an idea of the network traffic. Additionally, in some ways, TCPDump provides even more granular analysis and filtering capabilities, with the ability to have the output piped to other commands.
