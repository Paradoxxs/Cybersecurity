Post exploitation is the final phase after having achieved access to the targets.

Shell vs terminal 
 - Shell gives the ability to send command to the target in raw input and get responses in raw 
example short cut is a big problem in shell access, where they are not available to the user. 
editing files with shell can be very problematic. 

Escalating to terminal access
	 - Windows 
		 - telnet, mstsc, install ssh. 
 	- Linux
	 	- Use python shell for more terminal access 
			 - python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/sh');"
		 	- ssh or telnet 
	- [[Metasploit#^998485]]
 - using the -t option in [[Netcat]] allows for telnet terminal. 
 - By passing [[Firewall]] rules can be done using a Netcat relay. 
	 - Example at machine block inbound connection on ssh(22) and telnet(23) 
	 - The attacker can use a netcat relay on the local host to connect to ssh or telnet. There by bypassing the firewall.

- Transfer of files to target machine 
	- This can be done it two ways, either pushing the file to the target machine, Or have the target machine pull the file. (The pulling could be from a trusted cloud service.)
	- Information pillage
		- Passwords
			- Unix/Linux /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
			- Win : Sam and cached credentials, servicec account stored in LSA of registry. 
		- Crypto keys
		- Source code
		- Files containing passwords. 
		- [[Wireless]] pre-shared keys 
		- Server specific 
			- Dns server: zone files
			- Web server: Document root 
			- Mail server: Email inventory
			- Client: software 

When gain access to an target, often it not possible to install tools on the machine, there for knowing how to use build-in [[CMD]] tools to gain access further into the network. allowing us to keep the footprint as small as possible. 

Credential dump 
	The goal of cred dumping is for the machine to dump all local stored credentials 
	These credential are often stored in [[SAM]] files. 
	[[Minikatz]] is a tools that can be used find stored credentials stored on the machine in their hash value. 
	
Credential path 
	What is the shortest way to Domain admin?
	With tools such as [[BloodHoundAD]] allows to find relationship in [[AD]].
