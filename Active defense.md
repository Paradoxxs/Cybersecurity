Within MITRE Shield, active defense ranges from basic cyber defensive capabilities to cyber deception and adversary engagement operations. The combination of these defenses allows an organization to not only counter current attacks but also to learn more about that adversary and better prepare for new attacks in the future.

The goal of active defense is to take an active role in identifying the hackers and malware by setting up honey tokens, users, servers and etc.
