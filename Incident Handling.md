Incident handling is an action plan for dealing with intrusion, cyber-theft, denial of service, natural disaster and other security events. The incident response plan help to know what to do when an incident occurs.

The six stages of incident handling 
	-	Preparation : Plan for the eventuality of an incident
	-	Identification 
	-	Containment : Isolating the incident to prevent it from spreading
	-	Eradication : Eliminating the source of the incident
	-	Recovery : Restore services 
	-	Lessons-learned : Follow-up meeting what happened and why. 
	
Preparation 
	The first step of incident handling. The tasks associated to this step is everything done before the incident. An important parts is to have policy ready on how to deal with incidents. 
	Train for the incidents before they happen is other a overlooked part of preparation. 
	
Identification
	Correctly identify the incident could make between cleanup the incident in matter of minutes or hours and days. One the incident have been identify the incident the correct people need to be notified. 
	
Containment
	The goal is to stabilize the environment, contain the environment both physical and virtual. Change passwords 
	
Eradication
	Before the system goes back online, the handler must make sure that the problem and vulnerability that the attacker used have been eradicated, but also identify and remove every additional backdoor left by the attacker. After the system is recovered it good idea to run [[Vulnerability Scanning]] to ensure the problem is fixed. 
	
Recovery
	When in the recovery phase it important that vulnerable systems are not restored. There are two options when restoring system, installing the OS and application anew or restoring the system from a trusted backup and patching the system. 

Lessons learned 
	Identify the areas of improvement, it important the lessons learn is done within 24 hours after the end of the incident ensuring that everything if fresh. 
	The goal is to create the executive summary should be a brief synopsis of the incident, the steps taken to recover and recommendations.
	
	
Common mistake in incident handling 
	-	Incomplete notes
	-	Mishandling evidence
	-	Failure creating working backups
	-	Failure to contain or eradicate
	-	Failure to prevent re-infection
	-	Failure to apply lessons learned.
