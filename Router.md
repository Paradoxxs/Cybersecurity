Router
A router is a network device that forwards data based on a logical address. In the case of TCP/IP networks the router would forward data based on IP addresses of systems. If youâ€™re on your home network and want to visit Google.com, your request will go to the router (DNS will convert the domain name Google.com into the IP address), and your request will be sent over the internet to the Google.com web server IP.
