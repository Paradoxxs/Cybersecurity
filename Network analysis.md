Threat Hunter: Threat Hunters will analyse PCAPs and live traffic whilst hunting for advanced threats that are acting covertly within the network. This can include looking for unusual communications such as traffic on non-standard ports, scanning activity, exfiltration, and more. A deep understanding of protocols, including custom or unexpected protocols, and normal activity is extremely important.

SOC/Security Analyst: Security Analysts will be monitoring and responding to attacks over the network, and need to be able to differentiate normal activity from suspicious activity. They will likely observe and respond to port scanning, vulnerability scanning, distributed denial of service attacks, and unusual network traffic cases every day.

Threat Simulation Specialist/Penetration Tester: Not only does this role involve the identification of open ports and running services, these guys need to know how to hide their traffic both externally and when they gain access to the network, so they can pivot and move from system to system, hiding from network defenders. Understanding networking principles will help them effectively control systems remotely, and remain undetected by blending in with normal traffic.
