Vulnerability Management is the process of identifying security flaws and vulnerabilities in software, reporting on these so they can be fixed, the goal is to reducing the risk and impact of cyber-attacks by reducing the attack surface. The process of vulnerability  management is broken down in four steps 
	-	Identification : Using scanners, manual techniques and asset discovery to identify and record systems with the security flaws [[CVE]]]] they have with scores based on [[CVSS]]
	-	Reporting the issue to stakeholders such as the system owner so the flaws can be addressed. 
	-	Remediation the process of fixing the security issues 
	-	 Reassessment ensure the issues have been successfully fixed. 
This process is cyclic and should be done routinely. 	

Roles 

-	Threat intelligence analyst
	Receiving and reporting on newly released vulnerabilities.
-	Vulnerability analyst 
	Identifying, reporting on, and helping to remediate vulnerable assets to harden the system and reduce risk from cyber-attacks. Daily tasks include vulnerability scanning, analysing results, performing manual checks, report on security flaws, and keeping up-to-date with the latest publicly available news regarding vulnerabilities, as well as receiving threat intelligence reports from Intelligence Analysts.
-	Incident Responder
	Knowledge about vulnerabilities, and how to deal with compromises as a result of successful exploitation is key in knowing how to respond in the most effective way.
-	Red Team
	Knowing how to identify and scan for vulnerabilities and security flaws is key to this role, allowing you to exploit systems and gain access for security purposes, reporting on these so that Vulnerability Analysts can work with stakeholders to get the systems remediated.
