Digital forensics is a branch of forensics science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. So, Forensics is the technical process of recovering or collecting evidence that will be used in an investigation. In regards to Security Operations, this discipline is often associated with monitoring of employees to maintain a high-security posture, aiding with incident response to reveal details of how a compromise occurred and any post-actions (known as DFIR), as well as other tasks which require a ‘deep-dive’ into technical aspects.
