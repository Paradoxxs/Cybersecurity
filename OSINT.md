Open source intelligence is data that has been obtained from publicly-available sources

OSINT sources can be a great way to discover information about a target company or individual. By working out what systems a company uses, the right exploits and attack methods can be planned out in advance. Employee information can be harvested, allowing potentially effective social-engineering attacks, and spear-phishing email campaigns to be conducted, tailored to their intended targets to make them more believable. A company should be careful about what information their systems and employees are sharing online. The process of collecting this information for malicious purposes is commonly referred to as target information gathering, or passive information gathering
